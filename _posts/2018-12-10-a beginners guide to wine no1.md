Hello newbies! In this post I’m aiming to give you a little overview of wine… in the most basic terms. I don’t want to overwhelm anyone with a truckload of details right at the beginning of their journey to wine-heaven, and you can find more detailed info on specific bits and bobs linked throughout, for those curious cats out there.

## how it's grown
### weather & climate
So, the process begins in the vineyard, and is based on all those principles you learnt in high school biology. The vines need the right amount of sunlight, water and heat to flourish. They are grown in different ways depending on the variety of grape and the climate. One thing we should get straight right away is the difference between climate and weather.

Think of it this way: weather is short-term, climate is long term. So you could have a wine-growing region that has a cool climate, but may have suffered extremely hot weather conditions last summer. More on climate and the impact it has on wine here.

### water
Turning our attention to water… there are two ways that a vine can get water: rainfall or irrigation. Some parts of the world (e.g. Bordeaux) forbid irrigation, meaning that the growers spend a lot of time agonising about the weather! Too much or too little water can negatively impact not only the quality of the wine made but also the quantity, due to fluctuations of harvestable grapes each year.

### sunlight
Vines need sunlight along with carbon dioxide in order to photosynthesise. This process generates food for the vine so that it can grow and ripen its grapes.

### heat
Different grape varieties require different amounts of heat in order to grow, flower, produce fruit, and ripen the fruit. This is why you will see certain varieties being grown in some climates but not others. The important number here is 10 degrees celsius, which is the minimum temperate a vine needs to grow.

## the life cycle of the vine
What about timing? When is harvest? What happens to the vines during the winter? All valid questions! And one key thing to remember is that this varies depending on which hemisphere you’re talking about. Everything in the Southern Hemisphere is, as you might expect, the opposite of it’s Northern counterpart.

### Northern hemisphere
During the winter months (Dec-March) the vines are dormant to protect themselves from the cold. They look rather bare and lifeless so don’t visit wine country at the time! By April the vines have budded and start growing new shoots, which flower and start to form the actual grape by May/June time. Over the summer the grapes ripen, and are harvested around September/October.

### Southern hemisphere
The vines are dormant between July and September, budding by about October time. The shoots start appearing in November and by December, the vines have flowered and grapes are forming. They ripen by about March and are harvested by April.

## how it's made
This is where things get a little more complex, as the method varies depending on the type of wine being made: red, rosé, white, sweet or sparkling. More detailed information on each method can be found here, but for the sake of brevity I will just provide a basic overview right now.

After the grapes have been harvested, they go through a sorting process to ensure that only the high quality grapes end up being turned into wine. As the use of technology is on the rise within the wine-making industry, optical sorting machines are being used more and more. These machines are more efficient than relying on the human eye, as the machine can accurately and quickly discard grapes that are underripe or damaged using software and high-tech cameras.

Depending on the type of wine being made, the grapes may be destemmed using a special machine. Another process that may take place in the same machine is crushing, which breaks the skin of the grapes allowing juice to begin flowing. In order to get the majority of the juice separated from the flesh and seeds of the grapes, they must be pressed. For red wine, this happens after fermentation. For white wine, pressing occurs before fermentation.

Before fermentation takes place, some adjustments may be made to the juice to either sweeten or acidify it. This often depends on the weather that year, and the level of sugar that has consequently accumulated in the grapes.

### fermentation
This is where the magic starts to happen, and the juice turns into alcohol. Now, in order for this to happen, you need yeast. Some winemakers add what is called cultured yeast because it is reliable and the results it produces are predictable. If you are making a large amount of wine that is expected to be very similar and consistent from year to year, then this is your best bet.

Other winemakers may prefer to use what is known as ambient yeast, which is basically the yeast that is already present in the winery atmosphere and on the grape skins. This is less predictable than using cultured yeast, but for some smaller scale winemakers the reward of complex, nuanced wines is worth the risk.

Another important number to remember is 35 degrees celsius – the temperature at which yeast dies. Obviously, you don’t want to kill the yeast before it has done its job converting sugar to alcohol, so during fermentation you have to keep a close eye on the temperature of the wine.

#### malolactic fermentation
Also known as MLF, or malo. This is definitely a buzzword that you will start to hear more and more as you begin your journey into the wine world. All red wine undergoes this process, but only some whites do. After the alcoholic fermentation has taken place, MLF is used to change malic acid (imagine the flavour in a Granny Smith apple) into lactic acid (think cream and milk). The lactic acid is less astringent, but can also carry some of these dairy flavours and characteristics with it, hence why not ALL white wines undergo this process. If you’re a fan of California Chardonnay, you’ll know what I’m talking about when I say buttery. MLF imparts soft, buttery notes which is not always what a winemaker may be looking for.

There are three main ways of stopping MLF from happening, which you will learn in the post on white wine-making.

### maturation & blending
Some wines are left to mature in the tanks they were fermented in, whereas some wines don’t really benefit from this (often white wines). Oak barrels of varying sizes may be used to mature the wines, impart oaky flavours and allow for a little oxygen to come into contact with the wine. As you may know, some wines benefit greatly from being matured after they have been bottled (think Bordeaux). Another buzzword you have probably caught wind of is blend. This can mean several things. It might be a blend of varietals (in keeping with the Bordeaux theme, think Cabernet Sauvignon/Merlot). It could also just mean blending wines from different tanks. Depending on the scale of production, a wine maker may have several tanks full of one varietal of wine, and they may have treated the tanks slightly differently during the fermentation process, or the grapes in each tank might be from different parts of the vineyard. This could leave the wine maker with 3 or 4 different tasting tanks of wine, and hence the choice of whether to blend them or bottle them separately. Before bottling takes place, wine is often treated to clarify it and stabilise it. This may involve the use of filters and chemicals like sulphur dioxide.

### bottling
Finally, at the end of the process, the wine is packaged up ready for the consumer. Some wines are required to be aged for specific amounts of time in bottle before they can be sold (e.g. most Riojas). It should be noted that some wine never sees a bottle, instead going into a bag, which in turn ends up in a box. Yes, Franzia, we’re talking about you. That being said, not all boxed wine is destined for frat parties. As environmental concerns are becoming more widespread, some producers are turning to larger format bag-in-box wine as a way of cutting down on packaging waste. Speaking of environmental concerns, bottled wine is changing too. Cork is on the decline, with other options such as screw-cap and synthetic corks becoming more and more popular. I even saw recently that a company in the UK is making flat bottles out of plastic, designed to fit through your letterbox. Who knows what’s next…
