Now that we’ve covered all the preliminary stuff like the actual growing of the grapes and making of the wine, we can get into the best bit: how to drink it! At this point you may want to check out this post on the tools of the trade, because things like having a good wine glass can really improve your tasting experience.

## storage
This is really important, especially if you live in a particularly extreme climate with either very hot or very cold weather. The key thing to remember here is constancy. If you’ve got your wine stored in your kitchen, upright on the counter, take note! Firstly, any wine with a real cork in it is best stored horizontally to keep the cork moist and in good condition. If your wine is sealed with a screw cap then don’t worry about keeping it horizontally. Another bad place for long term storage of your wine is your fridge. I know, this might sound weird, but the fridge is way too cold for storing your wine unless you are going to drink it straight away and hence want to chill it down.

Your kitchen tends to be a bad place to store wine because the temperature can fluctuate frequently. You might have your central heating on, your AC on, your oven on… You get the picture. A wine fridge kept between 10-15°C (about 55°F) is the holy grail, but that’s not exactly something most houses/apartments are equipped with. If you have a basement, or better yet, a cellar, then Bob’s your uncle and you’re sorted! If not, find the place in your apartment or house that tends to maintain a steady, low temperature.

Worst case scenario, and you can’t think of anywhere suitable, avoid buying lots of wine that requires storage. Buy as you drink, and then perhaps as you get more obsessed with wine (it’s inevitable!), you might end up investing in a small wine fridge (see this post).

One other little thing to bear in mind is temperature when you are buying your wine. If you live somewhere hot like me (Texas summers are something else), then please please please don’t leave your wine in the car! The same applies if you’re somewhere freezing cold like Salt Lake City. Give your wine its best possible chance to be delicious!

Storage isn’t just what you do with your wine before you drink it. Assuming that you don’t make your way through the entire bottle, you’ve got to keep it fresh for your next glass. There are two main types of preservation available to the consumer, one at each end of the price spectrum. Something like a Vacu Vin Wine Saver is cheap and can often be found at the supermarket or liquor store, and definitely online. They are easy to use and cost about $10, and will keep your wine fresh for a couple of days. If you are wanting to go high-end, or want to be able to have one glass from a bottle then keep it fresh for months and months, then you’re going to want a Coravin. These are in the hundreds of dollars, but they are definitely worth it if you want to taste from more expensive bottles of wine without committing to drinking the whole bottle. More deets on both of these in this post.

Last but not least, what about sparkling wine?! I have the perfect find for you if you live in the USA. I haven’t found a replica on the UK market yet but it’s probably out there somewhere if you scour the internet hard enough. This baby is $6 and works AMAZINGLY. It will keep your sparkling wine bubbly for dayyyysss. The clamp that goes around the neck of the bottle works so well at keeping the pressure in. A word of warning though, if you have left one of these guys on your bottle of fizz for more than a couple of days: it will eject with some serious force because of all that pressure build up, so just be careful please. I don’t want anyone losing an eye!

## pairing
Before we get into any nitty gritty here, my main piece of advice would be to experiment. Don’t be afraid to try an unusual or weird-sounding pairing, you never know how good it might be. Even if it’s not good, you’ll still have learnt something. On the other hand, if you prefer to drink wine without food as you find it distracting, that’s totally fine too. Especially if you are new to the whole sniffing, swirling and tasting deal, it can seem overwhelming to not only try and discern the flavours in the wine by itself, but to perceive the changes that take place when you pair it with specific foods.

That being said, wine is most commonly consumed alongside food, so knowing some of the basics is really helpful. Otherwise, you might end up with a wine that is totally destroyed by your food, which to me seems like a waste of a wine opportunity, and no-one wants wasted wine! In my opinion, the two key areas to remember are spicy food and acidic food.

### spicy
Us Brits love a good curry, and so many foods such as Mexican, Indian, Thai and Vietnamese can all have spicy elements. The motto is easy to remember, and although it might perturb some of your fellow diners, I guarantee that as soon as they actually try the pairing, they will understand and fall, humbled, at your feet. Sweet to beat the heat. So next time you grab a bottle to go with your curry, make it something low alcohol, fruity, and with some residual sugar in there. Some ideas would be Gewurztraminer, Pinot Gris or an off-dry to sweet Riesling. Alsace and Germany are great regions to look for this kind of wine, although there are some great Pinot Gris coming out of places like Oregon too.

### acidic
When we’re thinking about acidic food, we’re thinking vinaigrettes on our salads, lemon juice on our smoked salmon, oysters with a vinegary mignonette, tomato-based dishes… If your food is high in acid, then your wine needs to be high-acid too. Classic pairings like Muscadet with oysters, or champagne with smoked salmon are a great place to start. For me personally, as I eat a lot of foods which are both spicy and acidic (like a Thai green papaya salad), something with high acidity and some residual sugar like Riesling can work wonders.

While on the topic of acidity, let’s flip it on its head and talk about what else pairs well with high-acid wine. If you’re a little bit crazy like me, you might match your food to your wine, rather than the other way round. Sometimes, when I’ve got my heart set on a specific bottle for a dinner party for example, I end up tailoring what I cook to go well with the wine. If you’ve found yourself with a bottle of high-acid wine like a Chablis, NZ Sauvignon Blanc, or maybe an Italian red like a Chianti, then you can go with a rich, fatty or oily food and be on to a winner. I’m thinking Chianti with roast duck, Chablis with a creamy sauce, or NZ Sauv Blanc with gnocchi in a sage-butter sauce. Don’t blame me though if you end up eating a double portion of gnocchi because its richness ends up being perfectly cut by the wine…
