In this post you’ll find all my favourites for enjoying and making the most out of your wine. I’ve tried to include items across the price spectrum so there’s something for everyone, regardless of budget or how far into your wine journey you are. I’ve rounded up everything you’ll need to learn, drink, keep and enjoy wine, so what are you waiting for! Dig in!

A Vacu Vin is essential. Basically you use one of the rubber stoppers, then the tool sucks the remaining air out of the bottle so stop it from oxygenating. They’re not perfect, and over time air will seep back in, but they will keep your wine fairly fresh for a couple of days. Even if you decide to go full whack and buy a Coravin, get one of these two as they are great to travel with if you intend to buy a couple of bottles on your trip. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve kicked myself for not remember to take mine with me.

If you are a little further into your wine journey, or you have a habit of buying more expensive bottles, then a Coravin would be perfect. This is also a great gift to buy for someone you know who loves wine, and using it makes you feel all fancy. It was dreamed up by a medical device inventor who loves wine, and says he was inspired by needles used for chemotherapy. A hollow needle passes through the cork and into the wine, allowing for wine to travel out, into your glass, and for the space in the bottle to be filled with Argon, an inert gas. This prevents oxygenation. The needle is so thin that when it is removed, the cork effectively reseals itself. So clever. This has truly revolutionised the wine by the glass market across the world, allowing restaurants to start pouring glasses from super expensive bottles. The end result of this is that super expensive wine is more accessible to those of us on a more modest budget, as we can try it (just a glass) for a lesser amount than if we had to invest in buying the whole bottle. Yay!

Moving onto sparkling wine, I absolutely love this Champagne stopper from Crate & Barrel. I buy up several of them every year and give them as gifts, particularly to people back in the UK, where they are not available. I guarantee that they work far more effectively than any other design I’ve ever tried. To read more on why I love them so much, take a peek at this post.

An essential to keep tucked away somewhere are the Coravin refills. The Coravin itself comes in a variety of colours and levels of glam, and some of the sets come with a couple of these and some replacement needles. The cartridges last for several months.

You’ll probably recognize this waiters friend, it’s the OG of wine openers. It’s got all the bits you need, including a little blade for removing the foil on your bottle. If you’re lazy, like me, then invest in one of these bad boys. It comes with a foil remover and does ALL the work for you. PS, don’t forget to keep your corks and recycle them! And while I’m on about saving the planet, I’ll remind you all to obviously also recycle your wine bottles. Glass in the trash is not cool.

When it comes to pouring your wine, there are a variety of options out there to prevent drips. Essential if you don’t want wine all over your tablecloth/clothes/guests. You get the picture. You might have seen these disks at wine tasting events. They’re cheap and easy to use, and again are great for travelling as they take up literally no room in your bag. They are washable and therefore reusable.

If you want to get fancy and kill two birds with one stone, get yourself an aerator which, you guessed it, aerates AND pours at the same time. More air, less spillages. Perfecto.

Glassware, my favourite topic! I could write a mile-long post about this, and you don’t even want to know how many of my kitchen cabinets are filled with glassware, but alas, I will keep it short and sweet. Get yourself a decanter. They don’t have to be expensive, and they look great on the table as well as being very useful for aerating your wine. Very important with some wines (think Barolos) and will allow you to get far more out of the wine. One myth that I will dispel for you right now is the whole ‘open the bottle a couple of hours before you eat to let it breathe’. Have you ever seen the opening of a wine bottle? It’s tiny. Not much breathing going to be going on there, with maybe 2cm² surface area of the wine getting the oxygen. Instead, decant your wine, then it can really breathe. If you don’t have a decanter yet or aren’t sure if you want to invest in one, even decanting into a plastic jug is better than nothing. Try it, you’ll see what I’m talking about.

Let’s start with champagne glasses. There are some really terrible options out there that will do absolutely nothing for your wine. Most wine buffs will tell you that a smaller wine glass (a white wine glass) is the best way to drink champagne. I can totally get behind that, I agree that the shape of the glass will allow you to get more of the aroma from the wine. The only problem is the bubbles. All that surface area and your wine is going to lose its fizz real quick. So instead, I offer you two options. This one is erring more on the side of a white wine glass shape, if you want to be bold and take the plunge. If not, a more halfway point is this glass, which looks more like the kind of flute you’re used to, but has that tulip shape you need to enhance the wine. It still has a fairly narrow opening so you don’t need to stress too much about your bubbles disappearing on you.

So this is going to be a bit of a treat yo’self moment. If you haven’t heard of Zalto yet, then your wallet will be thanking you. These glasses are hand-blown, with the angle of bowl precisely calculated to mimic the tilt of the earth. I could go on and on about how wonderful they are, but really you just gotta try them for yourself. If Christmas is coming up, or a birthday, or payday, go for it. Get yourself one. But please be careful washing them! See my dish soap recommendation further down the post for more info.

When it comes to everyday glasses, if the ones you already have at home are anything other than tulip-shaped, or are thick-lipped, or square or any other weird design, then I’d recommend you get a new set. They don’t have to be expensive. Stores like Crate & Barrel have a good selection at reasonable prices (look out for the Schott Zwiesel ones). Another great place to pick up good crystal glasses is TJ Maxx. Look out for brands like Spiegelau. These red wine glasses are great value for money. Spiegelau is now owned by Riedel, and their glasses tend to be a bit cheaper.

These Riedel white wine glasses are also a great choice for everyday drinking. If you want to push the boat out, Riedel offer varietal-specific glasses too.

For those of you who want to get into the whole tasting thing, or if you’re contemplating doing a wine education course, I’d recommend getting some tasting glasses. They are the same size and shape around the world to help with consistency when tasting, and are also a great idea if you want to start a wine tasting club with family/friends. FYI, they’re also a great glass for drinking Port out of, so you can kill two birds with one stone.

If you want a first-hand account of what it’s like undergoing the transformation from wine-novice to pro, then you’ll love Cork Dork. It’s funny and informative, and you’ll learn about the crazy extents to which wine pros go to (yes, I’m talking about licking rocks) to widen their palate and flavour repertoire.

The Wine Bible is an absolute tome of a book, and is chock-full of tonnes of information about everything wine-related. I love the sections on different regions, especially things like where to eat when you’re in wine country and which bottles you should look out for on your trips to different wine-growing regions. This is a geat book to pick up and read a couple of chapters of, but also a really useful one to use as a reference point when you want to look up something specific.

If you’re far enough along on your wine journey, you’ll have inevitable heard the name Jancis Robinson. She’s pretty much a goddess of the wine world. I enjoy her writing style, and a book like How to Taste will be an excellent resource and companion for your at-home tastings. If you don’t get the opportunity to do a wine education course like the WSET, then this book will be great for providing an expert opinion to compare your tasting notes to.

The people behind Wine Folly have THE best infographics out there. This is their new book which is a bit more in-depth than their first, but that’s also a great buy and a really good place to start. I keep my copy on the coffee table in case anyone wants to have a little browse through it while they’re over at my place. If you want a guide to wine that is fun, informative and very easy on the eye, this is the one for you.

Great for browsing and referencing, Jancis Robinson’s Oxford Companion to Wine is an essential. Jancis is a leading lady of wine, so you know you can trust in this book to keep you ultra informed.

These coolers are perfect if you plan on taking your wine on a picnic or, let’s face it, if you live somewhere super dang hot like Texas, if you just want to eat dinner al fresco on your patio. You might be thinking, ah well if I’m at home I can just put my white wine/sparkling wine in an ice bucket to keep it cool outside. Yep, you can. But in the Texas heat, what do you think is going to happen to your lovely red wine?? Spoiled! The heat will ruin it. Light-bodied reds prefer something around 13°C (55°F), and even those big bold reds like Malbec want to be served at about 15-18°C (around 60°F). If you’ve every experienced a summer Texas evening that is 60°F then I will eat my hat. Pop one of these coolers around your bottle of red and you’re set. Just keep the coolers in the freezer until you need to use them and voilà.

Now you might already have a drying mat like this in your kitchen if, like me, you think drying racks are ugly and space consuming. Drying racks are also a precarious place to start putting your fancy wine glasses (you gotta treat those Zaltos with love!) and I’ve heard too many stories of people forgetting they already put their wine glasses in the drying rack then accidentally crushing and breaking them with a big old plate. Drying mats are a great solution, they are non-slip and you can keep them fresh by just popping them in the washing machine every now and then. They are also really useful to let your wine glasses air-dry on after they have been in the dishwasher, if you chose not to hand-wash them.

Speaking of washing up, an unscented dish soap like this is essential. It is kinder to the crystal that your glasses are made of, and doesn’t leave them full of perfumey scents that will ruin your tasting experience. If you’re going to put your wine glasses in the dishwasher, some people advocate for not using any detergent at all. The standard powdery tablet is not going to be kind to your crystal glasses, so if you want to use something in there I suggest using a more natural product that is also scent-free.

Once you have washed your glasses, you’re probably going to need to give them a little polish, and a microfibre cloth like this is perfect.

Back to the idea of having your wine outdoors, another great option is a Corkcicle which will keep your wine cool for hooouuuurrsss. Also handy because it means you can leave your glass wine bottles at home, and there are a lot of picnic areas/poolside areas that don’t allow glass.

If you’re anything like me, you’re going to spill wine all over yourself at some point (try not to be like me and spill on your wedding dress). Wine Away is a great product that will disappear your stains like magic without having to wash the item, so it’s perfect for something like a wedding dress, or something covered with beading. Keep one of these around the house, your guests will thank you when they inevitably spill on themselves too.

Last but not least, a good old journal is super useful to keep all your tasting notes organised and in one place. Get one that is nifty enough to travel with and you’ll never miss a tasting opportunity again!
