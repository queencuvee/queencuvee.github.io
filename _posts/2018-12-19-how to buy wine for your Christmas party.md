It’s that time of year again! Twinkly lights everywhere, glistening ornaments on the tree, the warming scent of cinnamon and clove wafting through the house. It’s time to get yourself a snazzy new outfit and host a Christmas party. Whether it’s a small get together with neighbours, a family gathering or an all-out partay extravaganza, one thing’s for certain: you’ll need wine!

Instead of giving you a list of my favourite specific bottles, I’m going to help you go over the thought process behind choosing the right type of wine, and give you some recommendations on varietals and regions. This way, no matter where you buy your wine, you should be more likely to be able to find something I have recommended, instead of going crazy trying to hunt down a specific bottle online (been there, done that, contemplated driving 4 hours to a wine shop that doesn’t deliver because they were the only place where said bottle wasn’t sold out). I would recommend that you find your local wine shop rather than buying at the supermarket. You will be doing your bit by supporting an independent retailer (if you have one locally), and even if it is a chain, they will have a larger choice and probably some good deals if you’re buying in bulk. 

When you’re buying wine for a party scenario, there might be a fairly large quantity to purchase, so cost is definitely a factor. You also want to keep things simple and not overwhelm your guests with too many choices, whilst also making sure you’ve got everyone’s tastes broadly covered. If possible, buy the wine in magnums so you have less bottle floating around.

You also don’t want the wine to be too intrusive. Yes, of course you want it to be delicious and enjoyable, but it shouldn’t be too distracting from the holiday cheer and catching up with friends and loved ones. You don’t want to buy some funky, unpredictable natural wine that is really inaccessible for wine novices and has people reaching for a beer. No sir. 

If you are going to be serving food (be real, of course you are, you can’t have booze without nibbles), then you might want to also take that into consideration. If you’re keeping it super simple with crisps/chips, nuts and pretzels, then your guests are going to be consuming hella lotta salt. This is easily remedied by providing wines that are light and refreshing. In France they call them vins de soif (thirst quenchers), because pretty much no-one drinks water to quench their thirst in France. Here are my top choices:

## France:
1. **Gamay** from Beaujolais (Villages preferably) or the Maçonnais is a classic choice for a red that is light, fun and fruity, whilst maintaining a good balance of acidity. It’s low in tannins, making it an easy drinker, and goes with pretty much everything. Feel free to serve it lightly chilled for added refreshment. (red)
1. **Beaujolais Nouveau** is another fun choice that also happens to be rather seasonal. It is released in November each year, and will definitely appeal to those with a sweet tooth thanks to its aromas of candy, bubblegum and cinnamon. (red)
1. **Picpoul de Pinet** is a fresh, citrus-driven wine with great acidity. Perfect to refresh the palate if your nibbles are pretty rich. (white)
1. **Pinot Noir** from Burgundy. A Bourgogne rouge from a big house like Drouhin or Jadot should do nicely. (red)
1. **Muscadet Sèvre et Maine Sur Lie** (made from Melon Blanc grape), particularly if you’re serving seafood. (white)
1. For those rosé lovers out there, I would recommend looking to **Provence** for something fresh, full of lemon, strawberries and cream. 

## Spain:
1. **Albariño** from Rias Baixas is fresh and citrussy with a vein of salinity running through it thanks to the vines being so close to the sea. (white)
1. **Rioja Reserva** – this is is the big boy of reds, perfect for pairing with meaty appetizers, or just for that friend you have that only likes “big reds”. We’re talking chocolate, leather, soft berry, smoke, vanilla, cloves. Sounds pretty Christmassy to me. 

## Other great options:
1. **Vinho Verde** from Portugal is fantastic value for money. Lively, full of citrus, blossom, hints of tropical fruits, a dash of minerality all topped off with zingy acidity and maybe a few bubbles. It’s also low ABV, making it a great “session wine”. (white)
1. **Gruner Veltliner** from Austria is peppery and bursting with citrus fruits. If you want something with sky high acidity to cut through your food this is the one. 
1. (Dry) **Tokaji** from Hungary, made from the Furmint grape. This is definitely something your guests won’t have tried before, and it’s perfect if you’re looking for something zingy and spicy with a hint of a creamy finish. 

If you’re going all out and making real food, then feel free to go for bigger bolder wines in the mix too. The other option, which admittedly is a little bit of a gamble if you have picky friends, is to go 100% sparkling. This is particularly nice during the festive season; most people feel that a glass of bubbles elevates an occasion. Fizz is also a good idea if you’re serving sweets and mini desserts or holiday cookies rather than a savoury spread.

When I say sparkling, I don’t necessarily mean Champagne. My suggestion is to instead look for a type of wine called Crémant. It is made using the exact same technique as Champagne, but is made outside the Champagne region of France. Because it doesn’t have the same brand recognition as Champagne, it’s consequently a LOT cheaper. It’s also delicious. My absolute number one favourite is a Crémant de Jura, from a region in Eastern France, right up next to Switzerland. Other well-known regions for Crémant include Alsace, the Loire, Limoux, Savoie and Bourgogne (Burgundy). Everybody’s heard of Prosecco and Cava as the other sparkling wines, but this is sure to be a conversation starter at your party.

My curve-ball suggestion is to go 100% festive and served mulled wine. This is great if you have any cheap red wine lying around. Here’s what you’re going to need:

**Citrus**: Lemons, oranges or clementines or mandarins, cut into thick slices

**Spices**: A few cinnamon sticks, 1-2 tbsp cloves, a grating of nutmeg, a few slices of fresh ginger

**Wine**: A couple of bottles of red, nothing fancy

**Sweetener**: I like sugar, but feel free to use honey instead. Add to taste.

**Liquor**: For that extra bit of Christmas cheer, a good glug of brandy, Cognac, Grand Marnier or Cointreau. 

This is very flexible, just use what you have and don’t worry if for example you have no fresh ginger. It will still be delicious. Pop all the ingredients in a dutch oven or soup pot (or Instant Pot or slow cooker) and heat gently, stirring occasionally. Don’t let it boil! You can keep it heating gently while guests arrive and it will fill your house with the wonderful smell of Christmas. Top it up with more wine/citrus/sugar/liquor as needed, and when you want to serve it just ladle it out into anything heatproof. I like these and these glass mugs. If you want to get fancy you could garnish with a few fresh cranberries and a cinnamon stick, or a slice of orange.
