If you have already started looking into wine education, you’ll know that it is expensive and time consuming. Before you make the commitment, you might want to know a little bit more about what you’re signing up for. I took my wine education through the Wine & Spirit Education Trust (WSET). It is a UK-based provider, but is globally recognised in the beverage and hospitality industry, and its courses are taught all over the world.

There are 4 levels available, with Level 4 being the Diploma that takes at least a year to complete, and Level 1 being just a 1 day course. The Level 1 is optional, and I didn’t choose to take it, instead moving straight on to Level 2.

## choosing a provider
Wanting to do something a bit different, I decided to combine my Level 2 course with a trip to Bordeaux. Before the 3 day course started, I enjoyed the city, ate oysters at the market, visited several vineyards and wineries, did plenty of wine tasting and spent some time at the Cité du Vin. This is a great wine museum in Bordeaux that also has a tasting section where you can sample wine from across the world, and a brilliant shop. Needless to say, I had several bottles to lug home with me after my afternoon spent there.

For the course, I chose the Bordeaux Wine Campus. If you check out this section of the WSET website, you can see all the providers in any location where you want to take a course. Once you sign up, the course materials will be posted to you. This will include a text book, a tasting chart, the specification booklet and an answer book.

## preparing yourself
I would strongly advise that you work your way through the text book before your course starts, even if that just means reading it through once. Personally, I would also recommend making some notes from each section in the textbook. Also, take a look at the specification. Everything you will be examined on is in the specification, and it also has a few sample questions. Once the course got going, it became clear pretty quickly who had and who had not read the text book beforehand, so if you’re like me and you don’t want to waste everyone’s time with questions that are all answered in the book, please read it beforehand.

## the systematic approach to tasting®(SAT)
This is the guide that you will be working with for the Level 2 course. Your teacher will guide you through it and answer any questions you may have. If you want to give it a go for yourself beforehand, it is available here. Once you’ve got a handle on this, you’ll feel like such a pro in no time. The SAT gives you plenty of vocabulary to use to describe your wines, and you’ll realise how much analysis you had been missing out on before you started using the SAT.

## the course & the exam

The course itself is 3 days long, and we tasted 40 wines across the three days, with an hour long multiple choice exam at the end of the third day.

Each day we had a morning break and a lunch break which broke up the hours of studying nicely. Usually we would taste three or four wines at a time and take guided tasting notes as a group. It was a low pressure environment and I felt comfortable to ask questions throughout. The rest of the day comprised of our teacher working through the specification using a visual presentation and handouts that we would fill in as she discussed the different topics with us. There were also a few videos for us to watch at home.

The exam itself was pretty simple. You are given sample questions in the answer booklet, and I would highly recommend practising ALL of these, as they may feature on the exam. Make the most of the resources given to you, make sure you’ve read the textbook cover to cover, and ask about anything you’re confused by. If you do all this, then you’re pretty much guaranteed a pass. The marking structure looks like this:

Results will take about a month. I was notified by email by the Bordeaux Wine Campus, and then my certificate and lapel pin arrived in the post. This may vary depending on the school you chose. I achieved a pass with distinction, so hopefully you can too if you follow my advice! Don’t be intimidated by the course, just come prepared!
