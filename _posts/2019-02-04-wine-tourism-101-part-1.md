Hey guys! I thought I would do a post that covers the topic of wine tourism more broadly, before I deep dive into specific regions. If you’ve never taken a wine trip before, or would just like to make the most out of your next ones, here are some tips.

Anyone who knows me will tell you that I love to be really organised when it comes to travel. I’m not really one of those people who just arrives somewhere with no plans. So I thought I’d let you in on a few of my secrets. A lot of these apply to travel in general, with some being more specific to wine-related tourism. 

Before we get into it, let’s break it down into a couple of categories:

1. Travel arrangements – how you’re going to get there, be it bus, train, aeroplane or a combination. 
1. Accommodation – Airbnb, VRBO, hotel, B&B…
1. Activities – what are you going to do all day? Me, Id be happy eating and drinking all day, but I suppose you really have to space that stuff out across the day… We could break this down even further into: tours, tourist landmark sightseeing, markets/shops, museums & galleries, theatre/dance/music
1. Eating & drinking – we’re talking restaurants, fine dining experiences, hole in the wall joints, chic hotel cocktail bars, wine tasting cellars, I could go on and on.
1. Cultural immersion – what can you do during your trip to feel like a local. 
1. Money & insurance – how are you going to pay for things while you are away? Do you have a credit card with zero foreign transaction fees? Have you got any cash currency out from the bank/foreign exchange? Do you have a currency card? Do you have coverage for cancelled flights/accommodation/medical expenses?

## travel arrangements
I like to get started on [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) to get an overall feel for which airport near my chosen destination will be cheaper. Some cities have several nearby airports so this is definitely worth looking into. A word of advice however is to also check how far the alternative airport is from the city. You really don’t want to end up stuck in the middle of nowhere with poor transport links. 

Sometimes I look on other sites like [Momondo](https://www.momondo.com/) for great deals. Once again, make sure you check out the company that will be booking your flights on a site like [Trust Pilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/) to ensure that they are reputable and genuine. I recently had a great booking experience with [this site](https://www.cheapbestfares.com/) after I checked out their reviews. Always book with a credit card, and then you will have more financial protection if the website turns out to be fraudulent. Another thing to remember is that sometimes, smaller airlines like [Southwest](https://www.southwest.com/) don’t appear on comparison websites, so it might be worth checking their individual sites for prices. 

You may also choose to travel during your trip by train, and in Europe the trains are generally great value for money, fast and efficient (unless of course you choose to go to France during their rail strike that went on for over 6 months, good one). I like to use the European site for [Trainline](https://www.trainline.eu/) to book my tickets, and this way I don’t have to worry about speaking another language at the train station to try and buy a ticket, plus you can print them out at home before you go. 

Another key thing to remember to check out in advance is how you are going to get to your accommodation from your chosen airport. I find that looking on the website for the city’s Transport Authority is useful, as well as forums on [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ForumHome) or the airport website itself. A lot of tourists end up getting conned into paying extortionate rates for taxis, when there is often a great public transport alternative like a tram or a coach, running frequently at much more wallet-friendly prices. Your other option of course, if you have data wherever you’re travelling to, is a ride sharing service like Uber or Lyft. Whatever you go for, make sure you’ve picked it out ahead of time so you’re not left floundering in the airport wasting your precious holiday time!

## accommodation
Moving onto the topic of where you choose to rest your head at night during your trip, there are a few key things to consider:

1. Amenities – do you need a gym? Are you going to be staying for long enough that you might need access to a washing machine for your clothes? Do you want to option to cook your own meals? Wifi is pretty much a given these days, so we don’t need to worry about that too much. Are you going to be renting a car therefore needing parking? If you need more amenities, then an apartment is probably the best option, unless you’ve got purse strings that will stretch to hotel valet parking, overnight laundry and room service. 
1. Location – THIS IS SO IMPORTANT! Please, do you your research. Read a little bit about the different neighbourhoods and check that your chosen location is close to transport links and some of the attractions you plan to see. I like the travel section of newspapers like the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us/travel), the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/) and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/travel). Airbnb also has a [nice little section](https://www.airbnb.com/locations) too, with lots of pictures to help you get a feel for the areas. 
1. Budget – if you are trying to keep the budget down, then I would suggest that you avoid wasting your time looking at hotels, and instead look at apartments/Airbnbs. This will also help you cut down on costs because you can eat some meals in your apartment, buy your own wine rather than having to pay more to drink in a bar, and avoid the higher cost of breakfast at a café everyday by buying a few bits at a local food store instead (hello French bakery! What could be better than fresh baguette and croissants every day?!). 
1. Experience – are you looking for a bit of cultural immersion? If you want to live like the locals, you’ll probably want to avoid a hotel and go with an apartment, Airbnb or B&B. As you’ve probably gathered by now, I like Airbnb. More on that below.

### hotels
If you do choose to go with a hotel, sites like [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/Hotels?v=b), [Hotwire](https://www.hotwire.com/hotels/) and [Priceline](https://www.priceline.com/hotels) are great for finding deals. I also love [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels) as a good comparison website for choosing AND booking hotels – they often find the lowest prices out there for you, and you can read reviews at the same time! On that note, ALWAYS look at the reviews for a hotel on Tripadvisor before you book. Admittedly, sometimes you have to take them with a bit of a pinch of salt, but you should definitely make yourself aware of real traveller experiences and photos. 

### apartments
When it comes to booking an apartment or studio for your trip, there are some important preliminaries to consider, namely, who are you booking through, how is the money going to be transferred, and what kind of guarantee of a certain level of service do you have?

There are so many different websites out there for booking apartments through, with two of the main ones being VRBO and Airbnb. First up, always pay through their websites. Never send money directly to a host or apartment owner via bank transfer or anything like that. Secondly, take a look at what kind of consumer protection you are being offered. 

[Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) is great at helping you rebook if your host cancels on you, and even gives you a little extra money to spend to find somewhere equivalent. They also have a 24hr customer service line in case something goes wrong, but admittedly there can be some seriously long wait times for this. All payment is done through the website and if you need to dispute anything, it’s done through a central resolution system with Airbnb directly involved. The reviewing system on Airbnb is very helpful and fair, giving owners an opportunity to comment on guest reviews if they were factually incorrect, and vice versa. You can’t see the host’s review until you have posted your own, to ensure that it is unbiased. I would say however, that you should take the reviews with a pinch of salt. In recent times I have stayed in a variety of Airbnbs with glowing reviews that in my opinion, didn’t quite come up to the mark.

So take a little time to actually read through some of the recent reviews rather than just looking at the star rating, and don’t be afraid to leave your own honest review after your stay. One of the other great things about Airbnb is the level of verification for both guests and hosts, which you can read more about here. I love how many filters for different amenities there are, and there’s always a good range of properties in central locations everywhere along the price scale. 

With [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/), you have to be a bit more careful, as not all their properties come with their [*Book With Confidence Guarantee*](https://www.vrbo.com/info/ha-guarantee/travel-with-confidence?icid=il_o_link_bwc_homepage). Make sure you keep an eye out for that. In general, I also find their user interface a bit more old fashioned and clunky than Airbnb.
