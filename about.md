Hello and welcome to my blog! You may already know me from my food blog, [Queen Culinaire](https://queenculinaire.github.io/). If not, then here is a little summary of me in a nutshell. I’m Alex and I love wine. Things I also love: food, travel, mixology and cats. Unfortunately, as an apartment-dweller, cats are off the table but I consider myself very fortunate to be able to indulge in my other passions on a daily basis. And no, I don’t mean I get to travel every day, but I definitely spend a lot of my time planning future trips!

Anyway, back to the wine. I decided to do my Level 2 WSET (more on what this is here) and managed to snag a spot on the course in Bordeaux. Totally hooked, I went on to take the Level 3 in London, passing both with Distinction. Wine has been around for an extremely long time, and the options are endless. There is SO much out there to discover, taste, enjoy and share, so get stuck in!

The wine world can seem like an intimidating place to most people, and in some respects it is. One of the things I hope to achieve through my blog is to open it up and make it more accessible to everyone, regardless of age or socio-economic standing. I know, I’m going to sound like such a millennial now, but here goes. We truly do live in a time where there are more opportunities for people from all walks of life than ever before. Glass ceilings are being broken on the daily, and albeit slowly, the world is becoming a more accepting and progressive place.

That being said, if you like wine, get into wine! Don’t let your preconceptions get the better of you. The wine world will always be stuffy and snobby if we don’t take action to change that. Queen Cuvée is a place where you can find honest reviews, down-to-earth facts and info about wine and a couple of tips and tricks to maximise your enjoyment.

Cheers!
